# Crafting Design Systems

One day, design would be fully leveraged and scaled. Millions will be creating apps and experiences with pre-made content bricks the way we build with Lego. I want to be a part of that vision.

## Design Lead @ Graphiq.com

Create frameworks and interfaces to present complex datasets in forms of visualizations, videos, and vertical search engines.

Also in charge of the company’s visual identity.

## Maker @ Premade.io

Build out the idea of a drag & drop webpage builder where people can mix and match thousands of pre-made content blocks and create webpages faster than ever.
