Hello, I’m Samantha Zhang, a designer with a engineering mindset and a marketing degree. I understand users with qualitative and quantitative marketing research methods, and find elegant design solutions that are wildly scalable in code.

I’m currently working for Graphiq as a design lead in the beautiful Santa Barbara. 



## My Design Principles

1. Usability - Consistency - Beauty
2. Occam's razor
